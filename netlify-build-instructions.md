# Netlify Build Configuration Instructions

## Problem Analysis
Your site has a 404 error because Netlify doesn't know where to find your files. The netlify-deploy folder contains all your static files, but Netlify build settings are not configured properly.

## Required Netlify Configuration

### 1. Build Settings (CRITICAL)
Go to Site Settings → Build & Deploy → Build Settings and configure:

```
Base directory: netlify-deploy
Build command: echo 'Static site deployment ready'
Publish directory: .
```

### 2. Alternative Method (if above doesn't work)
If the base directory approach fails, try:

```
Base directory: (leave empty)
Build command: echo 'Static site deployment ready'
Publish directory: netlify-deploy
```

### 3. Deploy from Root (Recommended)
The best approach is to move everything from netlify-deploy to root:

```bash
# Move all files from netlify-deploy to root
mv netlify-deploy/* .
mv netlify-deploy/.* . 2>/dev/null || true
rmdir netlify-deploy
```

Then configure:
```
Base directory: (leave empty)
Build command: echo 'Static site deployment ready'
Publish directory: .
```

## Why This is Happening
- Your index.html exists at `/netlify-deploy/index.html`
- Netlify is looking for files at the root `/`
- Without proper publish directory, Netlify can't find your homepage

## Current File Structure
```
/
├── netlify-deploy/
│   ├── index.html ✅ (exists, properly configured)
│   ├── contact.html ✅
│   ├── privacy-policy.html ✅
│   ├── api.html ✅
│   ├── sitemap.xml ✅
│   ├── robots.txt ✅
│   └── all other pages ✅
```

## Verification Steps
1. Update build settings as shown above
2. Trigger new deployment
3. Check https://texttoreels.in/ - should load properly
4. Verify all footer links work correctly

## Alternative Quick Fix
If configuration is complex, you can also create a simple redirect in the root:

1. Create `/index.html` with:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=netlify-deploy/index.html">
    <link rel="canonical" href="https://texttoreels.in/" />
</head>
<body>
    <script>window.location.href = 'netlify-deploy/index.html';</script>
</body>
</html>
```

But the proper solution is to configure the build settings correctly.
