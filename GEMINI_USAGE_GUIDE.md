## üîß Customization Tips

### 1. Adjust for Different Cities
```javascript
// Generate prompt for different city
const prompt = GeminiPromptGenerator.generatePrompt({
  city: "Bangalore",
  district: "Bangalore Urban",
  state: "Karnataka", 
  region: "South India",
  pinCode: "560001",
  propertyType: "Villas",
  count: 2
});
```

### 2. Modify Content Style
Add these instructions to your prompt:
```text
CONTENT STYLE:
- Use formal, professional tone
- Include specific local landmarks and areas
- Mention transportation hubs (metro stations, airports)
- Include investment potential and ROI information
- Use Indian real estate terminology (crore, lakh, etc.)
```

### 3. SEO Optimization
```text
SEO REQUIREMENTS:
- Meta titles must be under 60 characters
- Short descriptions under 150 characters
- Include city + property type in keywords
- Generate location-specific content
- Include related search terms
```

## üìà Production Workflow

### 1. Data Generation
```bash
# Generate data for all locations and property types
node scripts/gemini-integration.js batch 1 production-sites.json
```

### 2. Data Validation
```javascript
const { validateResponse } = require('./scripts/gemini-prompt-template');
const validation = validateResponse(generatedData);

if (!validation.valid) {
  console.error('Validation failed:', validation.error);
}
```

### 3. Database Import
```javascript
const Site = require('./src/models/Site');

// Import generated sites into MongoDB
for (const siteData of generatedSites) {
  const site = new Site(siteData);
  await site.save();
}
```

### 4. Static Site Generation
```bash
# Generate static HTML pages
node frontend/scripts/smart-batch-generator.js
```

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test with 1-2 locations first
2. **Validate Responses**: Always check the response format
3. **Handle Errors**: Implement retry logic for API failures
4. **Monitor Usage**: Track API calls and costs
5. **Cache Results**: Save generated data to avoid regeneration
6. **Review Content**: Manually review generated content for accuracy

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid response format"
**Solution**: Check if Gemini returned valid JSON. Add response cleaning:
```javascript
// Clean response before parsing
const cleanedResponse = response.replace(/```json\n?|\n?```/g, '');
const data = JSON.parse(cleanedResponse);
```

### Issue: "API rate limit exceeded"
**Solution**: Add delays and reduce concurrent requests:
```javascript
const results = await gemini.batchGenerate(locations, propertyTypes, {
  maxConcurrent: 1,  // Reduce concurrent requests
  delayBetweenBatches: 5000  // 5 second delay
});
```

### Issue: "Incomplete data generation"
**Solution**: Implement retry logic and save progress:
```javascript
const results = await gemini.batchGenerate(locations, propertyTypes, {
  saveProgress: true,  // Save progress during generation
  maxRetries: 3       // Retry failed requests
});
```

This setup will give you production-ready real estate site data that perfectly matches your MongoDB schema and generates beautiful, SEO-optimized static pages! üè†‚ú®
